Introduction
============

Right now, this project doesn't do anything as I have just started it.  However, the purpose of this project is to implement a JavaScript implementation of [Zen Coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/) with jQuery.

Later on, I expect I may be able to expand upon the implementation to include some templating functionality.

Usage
=====

NOTE: Nothing is actually implemented, but this is what I am thinking right now:

**$.zen(ZenCode)** - returns the HTML string represented by the ZenCode string
